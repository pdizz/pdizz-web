    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a geek, a programmer, a gamer, a media junkie, and an outdoor enthusiast.
        I love programming and the power it gives me to create something from nothing.
        I'm a student of algorithms and I'm fascinated with solving impossibly large problems
        using clever techniques. </p>
    <p>When I'm not in the office I love to get outdoors and hit the trail. I've written
        some of my best code in my head while walking my dog. I like kayaking and mountain
        biking, and I enjoy the mental and physical challenge of archery and marksmanship.
        Whether it's new technologies or new trails I'm always exploring.</p>
